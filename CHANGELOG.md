## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **video-agent-mcp** — new package: parallel scene generation via Claude Agent SDK (PR #16)
- **video-explainer-mcp** — new package: 15 tools for synthesizing explainer videos from research (PR #10)
- **MLflow tracing** — `@trace` decorator on all 24 tools, MLflow MCP server plugin, `/gr:traces` command, and health check in `/gr:doctor` (PR #12)
- **Cohere reranking** — optional server-side reranking via Cohere when `COHERE_API_KEY` is set. Auto-detected; disable with `RERANKER_ENABLED=false` (PR #18)
- **Flash summarization** — Gemini Flash post-processes search hits to score relevance, generate one-line summaries, and trim unnecessary properties. Disable with `FLASH_SUMMARIZE=false` (PR #18)
- **Media asset pipeline** — local file paths propagated through video/content pipelines, shared `gr/media` asset directory with recall actions (PR #17, #18)
- **`generate_json_validated()`** — dual-path JSON validation in `GeminiClient` (PR #19, pending)
- **Project-level git rules** — branch protection policy in `.claude/rules/git.md`

### Changed

- CI: bumped `actions/checkout` v4 to v6, `astral-sh/setup-uv` v5 to v7, `actions/setup-python` v5 to v6 (PRs #13, #14, #15)
- Knowledge search: `rerank_score` and `summary` fields on `KnowledgeHit`
- Weaviate schema: local media path fields added to collections (PR #17)

### Fixed

- MCP transport JSON string deserialization for list parameters in `knowledge_ingest` and `knowledge_search`

### Deprecated

- **`knowledge_query`** — use `knowledge_search` instead, which now includes Cohere reranking and Flash summarization for better results with lower token usage. `knowledge_ask` (AI-powered Q&A) is unaffected

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **Knowledge store** — 7 Weaviate collections with write-through storage from every tool
- **Knowledge tools** — `knowledge_search`, `knowledge_related`, `knowledge_stats`, `knowledge_fetch`, `knowledge_ingest` for querying stored results
- **QueryAgent tools** — `knowledge_ask` and `knowledge_query` powered by `weaviate-agents` (optional dependency)
- **YouTube tools** — `video_metadata`, `video_comments`, `video_playlist` via YouTube Data API v3
- **Context caching** — automatic Gemini cache pre-warming after `video_analyze` for both YouTube and local files; session reuse via `ensure_session_cache()`. Large local files (>=20MB) are context-cached automatically on session creation
- **Session persistence** — optional SQLite backend for video Q&A sessions (`GEMINI_SESSION_DB`)
- **Plugin installer** — npm package that copies commands, skills, and agents to `~/.claude/` and configures MCP server
- **MLflow MCP plugin** — `/gr:traces` command for querying, tagging, and evaluating traces; `mlflow-traces` skill with field path reference and `extract_fields` discipline; `mlflow-mcp` server auto-installed via `uvx`; MLflow health check in `/gr:doctor`
- **Diagnostics** — `/gr:doctor` command for MCP wiring, API key, Weaviate, and MLflow connectivity checks
- **Retry logic** — exponential backoff with jitter for Gemini API calls
- **Batch analysis** — `video_batch_analyze` for concurrent directory-level video processing
- **PyPI metadata** — classifiers, project URLs, version alignment with npm

### Changed

- Bumped version from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0 (aligned with npm package)
- Unified tool count to 23 across all documentation

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- **Core server** — FastMCP root with 7 mounted sub-servers (stdio transport)
- **Video analysis** — `video_analyze`, `video_create_session`, `video_continue_session` for YouTube URLs and local files
- **Research tools** — `research_deep` (multi-phase with evidence tiers), `research_plan`, `research_assess_evidence`
- **Content tools** — `content_analyze`, `content_extract` with caller-provided JSON schemas
- **Search** — `web_search` via Gemini grounding with source citations
- **Infrastructure** — `infra_cache` (view/list/clear), `infra_configure` (runtime model/thinking/temperature)
- **Structured output** — `GeminiClient.generate_structured()` with Pydantic model validation
- **Thinking support** — configurable thinking levels (minimal/low/medium/high) via `ThinkingConfig`
- **Error handling** — `make_tool_error()` with category, hint, and retryable flag (tools never raise)
- **Caching** — file-based analysis cache with configurable TTL
