"""Weaviate collection definitions — 11 collections for knowledge storage.

Each CollectionDef maps to a Weaviate class. Collections are created
idempotently by WeaviateClient.ensure_collections() on first connection.
ALL_COLLECTIONS is the canonical list consumed by the client and tests.

Re-exports all types and collection constants so existing imports like
``from .weaviate_schema import ALL_COLLECTIONS`` keep working.
